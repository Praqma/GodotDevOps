# GodotDevOps

A summer project exploring contemporary software development and DevOps in a game development setting


## Project flow

### Workflow

We'll use the following basic workflow for now:

- Code changes should be tied to an issue in [the board](https://github.com/Praqma/GameDevOps/projects/1)
  - Reference in commit messages (`"WIP #3"`, `"Fixes #3"`)
- Code changes should happen on a branch
  - Name: Related issue number, lowercase, dash-separated `3-add-giant-lasers`
- Merging is done through a pull request

### Project flow

While the actual game being developed is extremely fun and interesting, let's not forget the overlapping goal of the project. For now, let's follow this little flow for now, we can readjust at any time.

- Game development continuously ongoing
- Monday and Wednesday fikas and project discussion 
- Friday demos
- During fikas and demos, we'll:
  - Find ways to improve our workflow, by either adding or removing processes/skills/tools
  - Book the time to hold some workshops/trainings to achieve those things
  - Where applicable, add them as isues to the board.
